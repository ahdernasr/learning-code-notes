### About

**learning-code-notes** is a repository containing my personal organised notes on concepts/languages I have learned or am currently learning.

I have decided to use VS Code and Markdown to write my notes since I found it greatly facilitates writing code and general notes at the same time.

- **Markdown**
- **Rust**
